                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Purple carrots turn blue when cooked because they contain pigments called anthocyanins. These pigments change their molecular structure when exposed to heat and changes in pH. At cooking temperatures above 180°F (82°C), the anthocyanins undergo a transformation that shifts their color from purple to blue.</p>
                        <p>This is a natural chemical reaction and is actually a fascinating demonstration of food chemistry in action!</p>

                        <p>Purple carrots begin to show blue coloration at temperatures above 180°F (82°C). The most dramatic color change typically occurs between 180-185°F (82-85°C). At 183°F (84°C), the transformation is particularly noticeable and produces a vivid blue color.</p>
                        <p>The exact temperature can vary slightly depending on the specific variety of purple carrot and the pH of the cooking water.</p>

                        <p>Yes, there are several ways to minimize the blue color change:</p>

                            <li>Cook at lower temperatures (below 170°F/77°C)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Adding acidic ingredients helps maintain the purple color because anthocyanins remain purple in acidic conditions.</p>
