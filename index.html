                <h2>What Happens When Purple Carrots Are Cooked?</h2>
                <p>Purple carrots contain special pigments called anthocyanins that give them their vibrant purple color. When you cook these carrots, something fascinating happens:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The purple color transforms into a striking blue shade</li>
                    <li>This happens at temperatures around 180-185°F (82-85°C)</li>
                    <li>The color change is more intense in alkaline (basic) environments</li>
                    <li>The transformation is completely natural and safe</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This color change isn't a sign that something's wrong with your carrots - it's actually a fascinating demonstration of food chemistry in action!</p>

                <h2>Why Does This Color Change Happen?</h2>
                <p>The science behind this color transformation involves:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>The Anthocyanin Effect</h3>
                    <p>Anthocyanins are highly sensitive to their environment. When heated, these molecules undergo a structural change that shifts their light absorption properties, causing them to reflect blue light instead of purple.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Several factors influence how dramatic this color change will be:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cooking Temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures accelerate the change</li>
                    <li><strong>Water pH:</strong> More alkaline conditions intensify the blue color</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> Longer cooking times lead to more pronounced changes</li>
                    <li><strong>Carrot Variety:</strong> Some purple carrot varieties show more dramatic color changes than others</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Questions About Blue Purple Carrots</h2>
                
                <h3>Are blue purple carrots safe to eat?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! The color change is completely natural and doesn't affect the taste, nutrition, or safety of the carrots.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I prevent purple carrots from turning blue?</h3>
                <p>You can minimize the color change by cooking them quickly at lower temperatures or adding a small amount of acid (like lemon juice or vinegar) to the cooking water.</p>
                
                <h3>Do all purple vegetables turn blue when cooked?</h3>
                <p>Not all, but many purple vegetables containing anthocyanins can show similar color changes, including purple cabbage and some varieties of purple potatoes.</p>
